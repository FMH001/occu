ReGaHss ChangeLog
-----------------

2017-04-09 

  * fixed a another timer related regession bug which caused that daily timers
    resulted in bogus timer executions once a daily timer was executed.

#### BETA4-2017-04-07 (65eed4a) Release #####################################

2017-04-06

  * added "AutoSaveDOMCycle" and "CheckModifiedCycle" rega.conf config options
    and restored the old default value of 12h and 10min.
  * added "SessionMaxCount" config option to rega.conf to allow to raise max.
    HTTP session limit.
  * modified command-line usage output to display version and build date.
  * fixed another timer related bug which was caused because two threads were
    fighting for the same data and suddenly overwrote data of the other thread.
    Now a mutex protects use of some public methods, thus should synchronize
    access properly.

#### BETA3-2017-04-05 (7f6cd65) Release #####################################

2017-04-05

  * fixed a bug in the time_t conversion routines which didn't convert DST
    vs. non-DST conversions correct and overly complicated.
    This was the reason for certain DST/non-DST related issues and also
    the reason for not formatting certain dates correctly in HM scripts
    (see https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=34439)

2017-04-04

  * replaced all localtime() and gmtime() uses with their reentrant
    versions localtime_r() and gmtime_r(). This should hopefully finally
    fix all the strange timer related issues with short timers (< minutes)
    which was caused by localtime/gmtime using internal buffers, thus old
    struct tm values were used ending up in certain runtime problems.
  * modified config AutoSave to force a save of the configuration every 60
    minutes instead of 12h. Also switched the modified config check to
    check every 5 minutes if the config had been changed and then
    immediately saving it. Furthermore, switched the autosave at
    termination of ReGaHss to the modified check thread instead.

2017-04-03

  * removed artifical max size for string variables. Now a string can have
    an arbitrary length like c strings. This allowed to enlarge the size
    of rega script programs to be edited which was previously limited to
    100KiB. Now an arbitrary long script can be added as a HM script.
  * fixed a minor but severe bug in the Timer management which caused
    that especially short timers (~ seconds) suddenly stopped because
    the end of day information pointed to 1970-01-01 and thus cancelled
    further timer executions. Further long term tests have to show,
    however, if all timer related problems are really solved by this fix.

2017-03-30

  * added missing data skipping upon termination to all relevant code
    passages. This fixes the "invalid free()" segmentation faults upon
    termination of ReGaHss which was caused because ReGaHss was trying to
    free memory of static instance data. Now ReGaHss can be properly
    terminated while freeing memory properly.

2017-03-29

  * fixed bug where upon termination of ReGaHss the current DOM config were
    not saved. Now the AutoSave thread will be properly signaled to close its
    operation while saving the current config before shutting down.
    This should fix issues where changed settings were lost if the system had
    been reset immediately after the change.
  * fixed the limitation of 200 ReGa script variables per variable list by having
    implemented a dynamic resize operation which in theory allows an
    unlimited number of variables now.

2017-03-28

  * fixed certain invalid memset() calls potentially caused unwanted crashed.

2017-03-23

  * created top-level Makefile

2017-02-12

  * restructuring project directory
  * initial commit
