ReGaHss ChangeLog
-----------------

2017-05-24 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed bug in syslog output function where in case an output contained
    typeical format specifiers (e.g. '%s') could result in segmentation
    faults.

2017-05-23 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed another regression bug where calling .Device() on a HSSDP resulted
    in a ScriptRuntimeError.

#### BETA10-2017-05-22 (334e81f) Release ####################################

2017-05-22 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed a regression bug which caused that obj.HssType() was not working
    properly anymore in a generic case. This resulted in incorrectly displaying
    temperatures in the WebUI with wind directions.

2017-05-21 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed system.Exec() function to be able to be executed without any
    parameters without interrupting a script execution.
  * fixed typo of "ID_GW_CHANNEL" constant

2017-05-19 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * added a workaround for a commonly but incorrectly use of .AlDestMapDP() on
    an AlTriggerDP() acquired object so that only a warning is issued without
    stopping script execution. In future, however, we should and will remove
    this workaround again.
  * fixed a regression bug with .Variable() not having worked anymore after
    the recent opcode fixes.

#### BETA9-2017-05-18 (8d2e2bb) Release #####################################

2017-05-18 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed all problems with function name clashes. E.g. the use of
    o.ToInteger() and o.BuildLabel() on a valid object 'o' returned the
    same 'string' result even though ToInteger() isn't a valid/accepted
    function of an object. Something like this was possible at many
    places resulting in unwanted side effects. Now a proper
    ScriptRuntimeError is issued instead so that script authors can
    correct these errors.

2017-05-17 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed a bug where Type() and VarType() was not available for all
    possible variable types. Now 'var', 'idarray' and 'object' can also
    be queried for their types. Note, however, that for actual objects
    only VarType() will be unique since Type() will then return the
    actual object type instead of the variable type name.
  * fixed a bug in while() and foreach() not raising any error if the
    specified condition isn't valid.
  * increased maximum number of iterations for foreach()/while() to 50000
    to facilitate our current hardware setup.
  * fixed /bin/hm_startup process to wait a certain amount of time for the
    rega engine to start up. Otherwise errors might occur during startup.
  * added Type(), VarType() and ToString() to idarray vartype
  * fixed a regression bug which caused that session ids were not correctly
    calculated on a CCU2

2017-05-16 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * added missing optional 'long_press' parameter to xmlrpc.ActivateLinkParamset().
  * fixed all xmlrpc namespace calls to correctly check for mandatory and
    optional parameters so that future calls to the rfd XMLRPC interface won't
    end up in random crashes.

2017-05-15 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed bug where calling xmlrpc.ActivateLinkParamset() with only two
    arguments resulted in a crashing rfd. Now ReGa will perform some parameter
    checks before executing the XMLRPC call.

#### BETA8-2017-05-12 (b98358d) Release #####################################

2017-05-11 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed some false thread termination error output when terminating
    ReGaHss
  * fixed bug in script parser where lines starting only with "!" resulted in
    commenting out the whole next line as well.
  * modified script runtime error output to display the famous '11622' debug
    messages as a 'info' log output instead and added a second normal 'error'
    output which outputs the reason for the error in a more human readable
    form with the complete code attached so that the buggy code can more easily
    be identified.
  * implemented the following random number generator functions to be usable
    within a rega script
      system.Random(min, max) - outputs a random integer number between min<>max
                                or a general random number without specifying
                                min/max
      system.Srandom(val)     - Allows to seed the random number generator to
                                a specific value or without 'val' to a random
                                value

2017-05-10 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed ToInteger() to correctly truncate real values
  * fixed '+' operator to be also used for concatinating a string with
    an integer or real value similar to how '#' is doing this
  * implemented some basic math functions which can now be used within a
    rega script for integer and floating-point variables

#### BETA7-2017-04-26 (9d4b309) Release #####################################

2017-04-26 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * modified all uses of string operating functions to use their buffer
    overflow/underflow safe variants instead. 
  * fixed incorrect deallocations of certain array-type variables.

#### BETA6-2017-04-24 (2ad8401) Release #####################################

2017-04-24 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * PONG events received will now be properly ignored without issuing an error.
    This should fix https://github.com/eq-3/occu/issues/44
  * added "AutoSaveDomOnExit" rega.conf option to allow to force a DOM config
    save upon termination (disabled per default).

#### BETA5-2017-04-09 (b89342f) Release #####################################

2017-04-09 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed a another timer related regession bug which caused that daily timers
    resulted in bogus timer executions once a daily timer was executed.

#### BETA4-2017-04-07 (65eed4a) Release #####################################

2017-04-06 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * added "AutoSaveDOMCycle" and "CheckModifiedCycle" rega.conf config options
    and restored the old default value of 12h and 10min.
  * added "SessionMaxCount" config option to rega.conf to allow to raise max.
    HTTP session limit.
  * modified command-line usage output to display version and build date.
  * fixed another timer related bug which was caused because two threads were
    fighting for the same data and suddenly overwrote data of the other thread.
    Now a mutex protects use of some public methods, thus should synchronize
    access properly.

#### BETA3-2017-04-05 (7f6cd65) Release #####################################

2017-04-05 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed a bug in the time_t conversion routines which didn't convert DST
    vs. non-DST conversions correct and overly complicated.
    This was the reason for certain DST/non-DST related issues and also
    the reason for not formatting certain dates correctly in HM scripts
    (see https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=34439)

2017-04-04 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * replaced all localtime() and gmtime() uses with their reentrant
    versions localtime_r() and gmtime_r(). This should hopefully finally
    fix all the strange timer related issues with short timers (< minutes)
    which was caused by localtime/gmtime using internal buffers, thus old
    struct tm values were used ending up in certain runtime problems.
  * modified config AutoSave to force a save of the configuration every 60
    minutes instead of 12h. Also switched the modified config check to
    check every 5 minutes if the config had been changed and then
    immediately saving it. Furthermore, switched the autosave at
    termination of ReGaHss to the modified check thread instead.

2017-04-03 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * removed artifical max size for string variables. Now a string can have
    an arbitrary length like c strings. This allowed to enlarge the size
    of rega script programs to be edited which was previously limited to
    100KiB. Now an arbitrary long script can be added as a HM script.
  * fixed a minor but severe bug in the Timer management which caused
    that especially short timers (~ seconds) suddenly stopped because
    the end of day information pointed to 1970-01-01 and thus cancelled
    further timer executions. Further long term tests have to show,
    however, if all timer related problems are really solved by this fix.

2017-03-30 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * added missing data skipping upon termination to all relevant code
    passages. This fixes the "invalid free()" segmentation faults upon
    termination of ReGaHss which was caused because ReGaHss was trying to
    free memory of static instance data. Now ReGaHss can be properly
    terminated while freeing memory properly.

2017-03-29 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed bug where upon termination of ReGaHss the current DOM config were
    not saved. Now the AutoSave thread will be properly signaled to close its
    operation while saving the current config before shutting down.
    This should fix issues where changed settings were lost if the system had
    been reset immediately after the change.
  * fixed the limitation of 200 ReGa script variables per variable list by having
    implemented a dynamic resize operation which in theory allows an
    unlimited number of variables now.

2017-03-28 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * fixed certain invalid memset() calls potentially caused unwanted crashed.

2017-03-23 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * created top-level Makefile

2017-02-12 Jens Maus <mail@jens-maus.de>

  * restructuring project directory
  * initial commit
